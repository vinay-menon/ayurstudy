                    Ayur Study Institution of Ayurveda Therapy offers you a decent means to earn a living. Our courses prepare you for life. We teach you the skills and we assure you the possibility of a job. Our courses are designed by professionals who have much experience of working in these fields and of teaching these subjects. And these courses are all job oriented. All of them prepare you for a career in the hospital and tourism industries. A career that is fulfilling from the points of view of both job satisfaction and of financial rewards.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our courses are very intensive and you do not have the luxury of forgetting what you have learnt, since you spend most of the hours of the day learning, with a holiday only on Sunday. 
                </p>
                <div class="fluff-img">
                    <img src="images/yoga1.jpg" alt="">

                <p>
                    Most institutions offer part-time courses where you have a certain number of hours of class each day, for a certain number of days a week. And as a result it takes a fairly long time to complete your studies. At our institution you get continuous instruction for the duration of the course. Of course it is no good to get more hours if you are only taught the theory or you only get to watch demonstrations. Here you are taught the theory, you watch demonstrations and then you practise what you have learnt. You practise repeatedly until you are thorough, until you are skilled in the application of what you have been taught.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why is it worth learning these skills? The one good reason is that there are so many jobs waiting for you. If you are wondering how you will get to know about them, there is absolutely no reason to worry. Our placement department will help you get placed in the best possible vacancy. Moreover we keep in touch with you after you have left us, to ensure that you are always needed; that you are always employed. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    And as far as the jobs we find for you are concerned, you can be quite certain that we make sure they are suitable for you. Safe and secure. We ensure that the ladies from our institute are as safe as possible. Our Executives of Placements personally visits most of the institutions where you may find your place.
